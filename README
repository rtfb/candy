Candy is a free implementation of the file system navigation and control
utility generally known as "commander". Probably the best known
implementation in the free software world is Midnight Commander. But
Candy is not a clone.

Candy stands for Commanders Are Not Dead Yet. And that's what it aims at.
The main idea behind Candy is to demonstrate how commanders can still be
useful on modern computers by taking a fresh view on effective file
system manipulations and user interface design.

Compatibility
=============

I'm developing Candy with Python 2.5.2. Using other versions of
Python 2.5.x should not be an issue. Even older Pythons should
also work, but I have not tried. If you do, let me know how it
behaved.

I was reported that Candy is more sensitive to the version of
wxPython. I am using version 2.8.8.0. Version 2.6.3.2 was reported
to have problems, so I advise not to run Candy on all of 2.6
series of wxPython.

You can check what version of wxPython you have, using the following
command:

$ python -c "import wx; print (wx.VERSION_STRING)"

On Windows, you will need win32api module. Candy will not refuse
to work without it, but you will lack some essential functionality.
You can get win32api module here: http://python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/
