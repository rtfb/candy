Candy is a free implementation of the file system navigation and control
utility generally known as "commander". Probably the best known
implementation in the free software world is Midnight Commander. But
Candy is not a clone.

Candy stands for Commanders Are Not Dead Yet. And that's what it aims at.
The main idea behind Candy is to demonstrate how commanders can still be
useful on modern computers by taking a fresh view on effective file
system manipulations and user interface design.
